time complexity:
best case:B(n^2)
worst case:O(n^2)
best case:_n_(n^2)



It has an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists.

Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over 
more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

 One thing which distinguishes selection sort from other sorting algorithms is that it makes the minimum 
 possible number of swaps, n âˆ’ 1 in the worst case.
 matlab jaisa isma hame pehla minimum value ka index find karta hai and then only usko swap marta hai.
 na ki bubble sort ki tarah continuous swap marta hai.
 kyu ki swap operation memory consuming hota hai
